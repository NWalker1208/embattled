Architecture:
- Need means of input and output, or at least debugging output.
- Will probably want some kind of signaling mechanism, flags, or both.
- If I implement a sleep opcode, that should provide a mechanism for giving each opcode a "cost" in number of cycles.
- Need way for robot to know if weapon is ready

Syntax:
- Need way to specify label reference in data
- Would be nice to have defines.

Implementation details:
- Should really figure out more scalable approach to implementing instructions.
- Replace old int types with stdint.h types.
- Use typedef to get rid of struct, union, enum, etc.
- Replace C strings?
