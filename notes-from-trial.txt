- Need instruction for reading from immediate address.
- Need means of input and output, or at least debugging output.
- Need way to write comments
- Will probably want some kind of signaling mechanism, flags, or both.
- Need way to load memory or immediate value into any register
- Maybe would be helpful to jump based on different register?
- Need way to specify label reference in data
- Maybe have way to specify address of assembly line?
- If I implement a sleep opcode, that should provide a mechanism for giving each opcode a "cost" in number of cycles.
- Should really figure out more scalable approach to implementing instructions.
